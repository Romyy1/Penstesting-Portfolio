# Penstesting-Portfolio

This repository showcases my practical experience in offensive security through hands-on
penetration testing labs, CTF challenges and vulnerable environments.  
It contains structured write-ups and professional reports from platforms such as Hack The Box,  
TryHackMe, DockerLabs, and The Hacker Labs.

Each report reflects the complete attack chain typically used during a penetration test, including:

- Information gathering & reconnaissance  
- Targeted enumeration  
- Identification of vulnerabilities  
- Exploitation and gaining initial access  
- Privilege escalation (Linux & Windows)  
- Post-exploitation actions  
- Technical documentation and conclusions  

The objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to approach security assessments
methodically and think like an attacker, applying offensive techniques in controlled environments.

This portfolio supports my career path toward becoming a Junior Penetration Tester, reinforced by the
eJPTv2 certification, my background in software development, and my ongoing work in expanding my
offensive security skillset.
